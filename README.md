# Cricketer's Image Identification

In this project I have used Indian Cricketer's Images Dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/omkarjc27/indian-cricketers-images">Link</a> for creating this image identification model. In this, if the python file is run then, webcam opened and whoever comes in reference to that camera will show he looks like which cricketer.
