# Cricketer's Image Identification

In this project I have used Indian Cricketer's Images Dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/omkarjc27/indian-cricketers-images">Link</a> for creating this image identification model. This project will identify the person who look alike the cricketers as per the dataset. After running the project webcam will open up and any person who comes in reference to the camera, a bounding box will appear around the face and the cricketers name will appear if that person looks like any cricketer.
